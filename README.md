I'm a Fullstack developer from Barcelona. I describe myself as a non stop learner, my journey as a developer started on my teens where I discovered a unlimited way to create new things from nothing.

Nowadays I enjoy developing and testing new frameworks and technologies, my favourite one is Vue!

- Piano 🎹
- E-Sports 🎮
- Draw 🎨
- Japanese Culture 🏯
- Rock Music 🎵
